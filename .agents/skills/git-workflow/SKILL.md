# Operational Protocol: Git Workflow

When committing code or documentation, you MUST follow these standards to maintain repository integrity and professional audit logs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Atomic Commits**: ALWAYS commit only the files you have explicitly modified for the current task. NEVER include unrelated changes or use "catch-all" commands like `git add .` or `git commit -a`. Stage specific files path-by-path to ensure no accidental inclusions.

## 1. Conventional Commits

All commit messages must adhere to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

**Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Permitted Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Formatting, no logic changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Build process, dependencies

**Rules for Descriptions:**
- **Imperative Mood**: Use "add", "fix", "change" (not "added", "fixing", "changed").
- **Case**: Use lowercase for the starting letter.
- **Punctuation**: Do not end with a period.
- **Length**: Keep the subject line under 72 characters.

## 2. AI Attribution (Mandatory)

Every commit generated by you MUST include a `Co-authored-by` signature in the footer. 

**Requirements:**
- The signature must include your identity (Antigravity) and the specific model version as provided in your current context metadata.

**Example Footer:**
```
Co-authored-by: Antigravity <Cerebras-Llama-3.1-70B>
```

## 3. Scope Guidelines

- **backend**: Changes to the .NET core logic, repositories, or services.
- **api**: Changes to controllers, middleware, or Program.cs.
- **ext**: Changes to the browser extension.
- **docs**: Changes to project documentation or planning files.

## 4. Execution Steps

1. **Stage Changes**: `git add <files>`
2. **Draft Message**: Construct the message according to the rules above.
3. **Insert Signature**: Append the `Co-authored-by` footer.
4. **Commit**: `git commit -m "<message>"`
