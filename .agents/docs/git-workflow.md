# Git Workflow and Conventions

These are the conventions that should be followed for version control and commits.

## Conventional Commits

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format for commit messages:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Build process, dependencies, tooling

**Examples:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat(portfolio): add performance calculation endpoint"
git commit -m "fix(portfolio): resolve division by zero in TWR calculation"
git commit -m "test(portfolio): add integration tests for performance API"
git commit -m "docs: update AGENTS.md with commit conventions"
```

**Rules:**
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")
- Keep subject line under 72 characters
- Reference issues in footer: "Closes #123" or "Fixes #456"

## Required AI Attribution

**Every commit generated by an AI agent must include the co-author signature with the name of the tool and model in the commit footer.** 

The model name must be dynamic. For example, if the current model operating is Gemini 3:

```
Co-authored-by: AI Agent <Gemini 3>
```

If another model or tool is driving the code generation, it should enter its own active name.
