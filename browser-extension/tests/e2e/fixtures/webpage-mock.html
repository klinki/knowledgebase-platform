      <h1>Test Article for Webpage Capture</h1>
      <p class="author">By Jane Doe</p>

      <p>This is the first paragraph of the test article. It contains enough text to pass the content extraction threshold that the extension uses when parsing webpages. The content extraction algorithm looks for article elements and paragraph tags.</p>
      
      <p>This is the second paragraph of the test article. It provides additional content that should be captured by the Sentinel extension when a user saves this page. The extension should extract the main content, metadata, and author information.</p>
      
      <p>This is the third paragraph of the test article. It continues the content to ensure we have sufficient text for the extraction tests. The webpage capture feature is an important part of the Sentinel knowledge base system.</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        "This is a quote that might be extracted as part of the content."
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>Final paragraph to conclude the test article. This should give us enough content for comprehensive testing of the webpage capture functionality.</p>
